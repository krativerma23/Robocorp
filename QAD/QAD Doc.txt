The QAD Enterprise Platform allows developers to easily extend the Web UI using low-code/no-code functionality. 
The first step in extending the Web UI is creating an app to store your data.

Apps

With the Apps view, you can view, create, and edit apps and app dependencies

App Registration

Apps that will be shared with others and included in environments with other shared apps must be registered with QAD so that they have a unique app registration code.

How to Register App

Click New: 
Click New to access the Apps form.

App

Enter the app name. This represents the logical name of the app.
App URI

The app URI is based on the environment namespace and the app name.
The format of the URI is: urn.app.environment_namespace.app_name.

App Label

App Registration Code
